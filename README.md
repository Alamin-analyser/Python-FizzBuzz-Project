## Python-FizzBuzz-Project

**FizzBuzz:**

Go through the integers from 1 to 100.

If a number is divisible by 3, print "fizz."

If a number is divisible by 5, print "buzz."

If a number is both divisible by 3 and by 5, print "fizzbuzz."

Otherwise, print just the number.

**I have used Python syntax to follow the criteria to complete the FizzBuzz project**
